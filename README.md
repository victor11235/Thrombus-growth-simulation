# Thrombus-growth-simulation

(2020) This is a research project I did in high school, where I used DPD (Dissipative Particle Dynamics) method to simulate thrombus growth at the mesoscale level. The majority of the source code (in C++) came from Lammps (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). For the purpose of this project, some extra source code was written and re-compiled, including a geometric model for blood vessel and an edited force model between particles.
